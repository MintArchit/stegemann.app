## Hosting
My hosting provider collects the following data in so-called log files, which your browser transmits:

IP address, the address of the previously visited website (referrer request header), date and time of the request, time zone difference to Greenwich Mean Time, content of the request, HTTP status code, amount of data transferred, website from which the request originates, and information about the browser and operating system.

This is necessary to display my website and ensure its stability and security. This corresponds to my legitimate interest in the sense of Art. 6 para. 1 sentence 1 lit. f GDPR.

There is no tracking, and I do not have direct access to this data.

I use the following hosting provider to make my website available:

GitHub Inc.
88 Colin P Kelly Jr St
San Francisco, CA 94107
United States

This is the recipient of your personal data. This corresponds to my legitimate interest in the sense of Art. 6 para. 1 sentence 1 lit. f GDPR, not having to maintain a server on my premises. The server location is the USA.

Further information on options for objection and removal against GitHub can be found at: [GitHub Privacy Statement](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/site-policy/github-privacy-statement#github-pages).

You have the right to object to the processing. Whether the objection is successful is determined within the framework of a balancing of interests.

The data will be deleted as soon as the purpose of processing ceases to apply.

The processing of the data specified in this section is neither legally nor contractually required. The functionality of the website is not guaranteed without the processing.

GitHub has implemented compliance measures for international data transfers. These apply to all worldwide activities in which GitHub processes personal data of individuals in the EU. These measures are based on the EU Standard Contractual Clauses (SCCs). Further information can be found at: [GitHub Data Protection Addendum](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/site-policy/github-data-protection-addendum#attachment-1--the-standard-contractual-clauses-processors).

## Contact Forms
Contact data is only collected from you if you use the contact form to send me a message or inquiry, if you submit an order to me using the online order form on my website, if you recommend a job online, or if you send me an online application. Your information is collected only to the necessary extent and solely for the purpose of fulfilling the stated purpose. For more information on online applications, please see [here](https://www.stegemann.app/de/kontakt/datenschutz/information-zum-datenschutz-fuer-bewerber.html).

## YouTube

I have embedded YouTube videos on my website, which are stored on www.youtube.com and playable directly from my website.

These are all embedded in "enhanced privacy mode," meaning no data about you as a user will be transmitted to YouTube unless you play the videos. Only when you play the videos, data will be transmitted to the YouTube server. If you are logged into YouTube at the same time, this information will be associated with your YouTube member account. You can prevent this by logging out of your member account before visiting my website.

YouTube is operated by YouTube LLC with headquarters at 901 Cherry Avenue, San Bruno, CA 94066, USA. YouTube is represented by Google Inc. with headquarters at 1600 Amphitheatre Parkway, Mountain View, CA 94043, USA. For more information on how YouTube (Google) handles user data, please see [http://www.google.com/intl/en/policies/privacy/](http://www.google.com/intl/en/policies/privacy/).

## Links

My website contains links to other websites in some cases. I have checked these links with reasonable care. I am not responsible for the content and data protection on the websites linked by me.

## SSL Encryption

For security reasons and to protect the transmission of confidential content that you send to me, this site uses SSL encryption. You can recognize an encrypted connection by the fact that the address line of the browser changes from "http://" to "https://" and by the lock symbol in your browser line.

When SSL encryption is activated, the data you transmit to me cannot be read by third parties.

## Further Information according to GDPR

**Deletion and retention periods of data**

If I have stored personal data from you, I process it only for the period necessary to achieve the storage purpose or as required by law.

If the storage purpose ceases to apply or if a statutory storage period expires, the personal data will be routinely blocked or deleted in accordance with legal regulations.

## Categories of Recipients

If you have provided me with personal data, it will generally not be disclosed to third parties. Disclosure will only occur

*   as part of fulfilling legal obligations to authorities;
*   within the scope of consent given by you;
*   to IT service providers, e.g., for the administration and hosting of my website.

## Transfer to Third Countries

Data transfer to countries outside the EU or EEA (so-called third countries) only takes place if specified in this privacy policy, necessary for the execution of orders, legally required, or if you have given consent.

## Rights of Data Subjects

Every data subject has the right to information under Art. 15 GDPR. If I process personal data from you, you have the right to rectification under Art. 16 GDPR, the right to erasure under Art. 17 GDPR, the right to restriction of processing under Art. 18 GDPR, the right to object under Art. 21 GDPR, and the right to data portability under Art. 20 GDPR. The restrictions under §§ 34 and 35 BDSG apply to the right of access and the right to erasure. In addition, there is a right to lodge a complaint with the competent data protection supervisory authority (Art. 77 GDPR in conjunction with § 19 BDSG).

If you have given consent to the processing of data, you can revoke it at any time in the same way you granted it. The revocation can be made informally, e.g., by email to {dp_email} or by a message to the contact details provided above. Revoking consent does not affect the lawfulness of processing based on consent before its withdrawal.

### Right to Object to Processing

Under Art. 21 para. 1 GDPR, you have the right to object at any time to the processing of your personal data based on Art. 6 para. 1 lit. f) GDPR (processing for the purposes of legitimate interests).

If you object, I will no longer process your personal data for the purposes covered by the objection, unless

*   I can demonstrate compelling legitimate grounds for the processing which override your interests, rights, and freedoms, or
*   the processing serves the establishment, exercise, or defense of legal claims.

If the objection is also or solely directed against processing for direct marketing purposes, I will no longer process your personal data for this purpose.

The objection can be made informally, e.g., by email to [datenschutz@stegemann.app](mailto:datenschutz@stegemann.app) or by a message to the contact details provided above.

## Legal Basis for Processing

The processing of personal data in connection with the use of contact forms is based on Art. 6 para. 1 lit. b) GDPR, provided that the purpose of contacting is to fulfill a contract or to take pre-contractual measures.

If I am subject to a legal obligation that requires the processing of personal data, the processing is based on Art. 6 para. 1 lit. c) GDPR.

If I obtain your consent for processing personal data, the processing is based on Art. 6 para. 1 lit. a) GDPR.

Furthermore, processing operations may be based on Art. 6 para. 1 lit. f) GDPR, which allows processing for the purposes of legitimate interests pursued by me or by a third party, provided that the interests or fundamental rights and freedoms of the data subject do not override those interests.

I use server log files, cookies, web fonts, embedded YouTube videos, and web analytics tools so that you can fully utilize all functions of my website and for the purpose of adapting and optimizing my website to your needs. When you contact us via our contact form and functions in my career blog, I use your data for the purpose of interacting with you and corporate communication.

## Obligation to Provide Personal Data

There is generally no obligation to provide personal data when visiting my website. Different regulations may apply due to contractual agreements. If the aforementioned personal data is not provided, it may not be possible to achieve the individual purposes described.

## No Automated Decision Making

I do not use fully automated decision-making processes according to Art. 22 GDPR.

## Changes to the Privacy Policy

Due to the continuous development of the Internet, adjustments to the privacy policy are necessary at intervals. Regularly accessing the privacy policy gives you the opportunity to stay informed about changes.

## Data Protection Information for my Social Media Channels

### Data Processing by Social Networks

I - Kevin Stegemann - maintain publicly accessible profiles on social networks. Below, I have listed the social networks I use.

Social networks such as LinkedIn, Xing, etc., can generally comprehensively analyze user behavior when their website is visited.

If you are logged into your social media account and visit my social media presence, the operator of the social media platform can associate this visit with your user account. Your personal data may also be collected if you are not logged in or do not have an account with the respective social media platform. This data collection can occur, for example, through cookies stored on your device or by capturing your IP address.

With the data collected in this way, the operators of the social media platforms can create user profiles in which your preferences and interests are stored. This allows for targeted advertising to be displayed both within and outside the respective social media presence. If you have an account with the respective social network, targeted advertising can be displayed on all devices where you are logged in or have been logged in.

Please note that I cannot fully trace all processing processes on the social media platforms. Depending on the provider, additional processing operations may therefore be carried out by the operators of the social media platforms. For details, please refer to the terms of use and privacy policies of the respective social media platforms. I provide the relevant links in the details for each provider below.

I have no influence on the storage period of your data, which is stored by the operators of the social networks for their own purposes. For details on this, please refer directly to the operators of the social networks (e.g., in their privacy policy, see below).

**LinkedIn**

I have a profile on LinkedIn. The provider is LinkedIn Ireland Unlimited Company, Wilton Plaza, Wilton Place, Dublin 2, Ireland. LinkedIn is certified under the EU-US Privacy Shield. LinkedIn uses advertising cookies.

If you wish to disable LinkedIn advertising cookies, please use the following link:
